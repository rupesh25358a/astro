# Astro GO on IPTV players
You can watch Astro legally on TiviMate, really, really soon, as soon as I figured out how to get the License Server URL from Astro GO and you have an Astro subscription.

# Links
[https://github.com/weareblahs/astro/raw/main/astro_links.txt](https://github.com/weareblahs/astro/raw/main/astro_links.txt) (These URLs were not usable without a Widevine Server URL)
  
If you figured out how to get the License URL for Astro GO, Submit an Issue with the tag "Found License Server URL" with the instructions.
